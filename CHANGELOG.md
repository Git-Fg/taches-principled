# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-03

### Changed
- **tp-session-audit plugin**: Merged standalone `capture` skill into `session-analytics` hub as CAPTURE mode. The skill now has four modes: CAPTURE, INSPECT, REVIEW, ISSUE. Added trigger phrases for "capture session", "collect artifacts", "headless capture", "run verification capture", "profile a skill invocation", "audit skill routing", "measure hook in vivo". Removed standalone `plugins/tp-session-audit/skills/capture/` directory.
- **tp-session-audit commands**: Added `commands/capture.md` as thin router to `session-analytics` CAPTURE mode. All four commands now route through the unified hub skill.
- **marketplace.json**: tp-session-audit version bumped to 0.3.0. Description updated to reflect four modes.

### Changed
- **Structural demotion: multi-agent-patterns, tool-design, claude-headless** — These three skills have been demoted from standalone top-level skills to markdown reference files within hub skill `references/` directories:
  - `multi-agent-patterns` → `plugins/core-principled/skills/subagent-orchestration/references/patterns-reference.md`
  - `tool-design` → `plugins/core-principled/skills/subagent-orchestration/references/tool-design.md`
  - `claude-headless` → `plugins/tp-session-audit/skills/session-analytics/references/claude-headless.md`
- **subagent-orchestration SKILL.md**: Updated to imperatively cite both new reference files. `when_to_use` updated to reference `references/patterns-reference.md`. `references/patterns-reference.md` (Architecture Design section) updated to reference `references/frameworks.md` for LangGraph/AutoGen/CrewAI implementations.
- **core-principled plugin.json**: Removed references to deleted skills. Bumped version.
- **Deleted skill directories**: `plugins/core-principled/skills/multi-agent-patterns/`, `plugins/core-principled/skills/tool-design/`, `plugins/core-principled/skills/claude-headless/`.

### Changed
- **task-lifecycle skill**: Added DOCUMENT mode absorbing `update-docs` workflow. New mode handles documentation after IMPLEMENT completes: multi-agent tech-writer flow with analysis + tech-writer + review agents. Task-lifecycle now has four modes: CAPTURE, REFINE, IMPLEMENT, DOCUMENT. IMPLEMENT mode routes to DOCUMENT after Phase 3 (DoD verification) before moving task to done.
- **task-lifecycle/references/documentation.md**: New reference file with README templates, JSDoc patterns, index document checklist, and quality gates migrated from `update-docs`.
- **Deleted skill**: `plugins/core-principled/skills/update-docs/` — capabilities merged into task-lifecycle DOCUMENT mode.

### Changed
- **Agent color standardization**: Assigned semantic `color:` fields to all 27 agent definitions across the marketplace per the Agent Color Convention table in CLAUDE.md:
  - `red` (judges/critics/security): tp-critic, sadd-judge, fpf-logic-verifier, tp-code-reviewer
  - `blue` (architecture/generation/analysis): tp-analyzer, sadd-generator, fpf-hypothesis-generator, tp-plan-architect
  - `green` (implementation/integration): sadd-synthesizer, fpf-evidence-validator, tp-global-implementer, tp-transcript-rules-integrator
  - `yellow` (caution/validation/audit): tp-skill-auditor, fpf-trust-auditor, tp-plan-verifier
  - `purple` (complex reasoning/scoring): tp-comparator, sadd-expander, tp-grader
  - `orange` (meta-evaluator/diagnostic): tp-subagent-auditor, sadd-meta-judge, meta-reviewer, tp-transcript-rules-analyzer
  - `pink` (distinctive specialist): tp-transcript-rules-auditor
  - `cyan` (investigation/research/tracing): sadd-explorer, tp-test-strategist, tp-explorer, tp-researcher, tp-debug-tracer

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-02

### Changed
- **tp-sadd agents**: Renamed with `sadd-` prefix in both filename and frontmatter `name` field to match spawn directives in `sadd` skill. Agents affected: `explorer` → `sadd-explorer`, `judge` → `sadd-judge`, `meta-judge` → `sadd-meta-judge`, `generator` → `sadd-generator`, `synthesizer` → `sadd-synthesizer`, `expander` → `sadd-expander`.
- **tp-fpf agents**: Renamed with `fpf-` prefix in both filename and frontmatter `name` field to match spawn directives in `fpf` skill. Agents affected: `hypothesis-generator` → `fpf-hypothesis-generator`, `evidence-validator` → `fpf-evidence-validator`, `logic-verifier` → `fpf-logic-verifier`, `trust-auditor` → `fpf-trust-auditor`.
- **session-analytics CROSS-ANALYZE**: Fixed cross-plugin reference from `taches-principled:debug-tracer` to `core-principled:tp-debug-tracer`.
- **session-analytics ADJUDICATE**: Fixed agent references: `tp-sadd:judge` → `tp-sadd:sadd-judge`, fallback updated to `core-principled:tp-critic`.
- **marketplace.json**: Bumped to 0.12.0.
- **core-principled plugin.json**: Bumped to 0.10.1.
- **README.md**: Updated version to 0.12.0.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-02

### Changed
- **core-principled project-maintenance skill**: Merged `archive-plan` (plan archival + learnings extraction) and `memory-curator` (memory audit/dedup/archive/clean) into a single hub skill with five modes — `PLAN-ARCHIVE`, `MEMORY-AUDIT`, `MEMORY-DEDUP`, `MEMORY-ARCHIVE`, `MEMORY-CLEAN`. The /archive command now routes to the unified skill. Removed the two old skills; bumped `core-principled` to 0.10.0.
- **/archive command**: Now a thin router into the unified skill (no body duplication). Argument-hint exposes all five modes plus `--abandoned` (PLAN-ARCHIVE override) and `--days` (memory age threshold).
- **refine MEMORIZE + rules-orchestration SYNC**: Updated CONTRAST references from `archive-plan` to `project-maintenance PLAN-ARCHIVE`. The writer/reader topology is unchanged.
- **MEMORY-DEDUP / MEMORY-CLEAN accuracy**: Replaced the false `--directory` and `--yes` flag claims (which `dedup.py` does not implement) with the script's actual CLI (`directory` positional, `--threshold`, `--format`) and clarified that the script is read-only — resolution is performed by the agent via MEMORY-ARCHIVE. The safety boundary is now explicit user confirmation in conversation, not a `--yes` flag. SKILL.md `argument-hint` and body are now consistent (no `--yes`/`--dry-run` claim).
- **MEMORY-ARCHIVE archive location**: Aligned all mode examples on `~/.claude/archive/memory/{category}/{date}/` (the manifest format). The MEMORY-DEDUP example previously showed `~/.claude/archive/memory/2025-05/` (missing the `{category}/` segment) — now correct.
- **marketplace.json**: Bumped to 0.11.2 (was 0.11.1). `tp-force-multiplier` removed (no longer in this marketplace); `tp-session-audit` retained.

### Added
- **project-maintenance references/memory-locations.md**: New tiny reference extracting the memory-location list that was previously inlined in both AUDIT and CLEAN modes.

### Removed
- `core-principled/skills/archive-plan/` (moved into `project-maintenance`)
- `core-principled/skills/memory-curator/` (moved into `project-maintenance`)

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **tp-meta capture skill**: New skill that runs `claude -p` headless capture with canonical behavioral-verification flags. Produces three artifacts: debug log, stream-json output, persisted JSONL. Triggers on "capture session", "profile a skill invocation", "run verification capture".
- **tp-meta session-inspect multi-artifact routing**: Extended INSPECT mode to route by artifact type — `.jsonl` → JSONL parser, `.debug.log` → debug-log parser (extracts [HOOK]/[API]/[PERMISSION]/[ERROR] events), `.stream.jsonl` → stream-json parser (per-turn delta events).
- **tp-meta meta-review CROSS-ANALYZE mode**: New mode fans out three parallel specialists (forensic-analyst on stream-json, meta-reviewer on JSONL, debug-tracer on debug log), detects convergence across analysts. High-convergence findings (≥2 analysts) are the highest-signal outputs.
- **tp-meta meta-review ADJUDICATE mode**: New mode validates each cross-analyze finding with parallel evidence-validator + adversarial challenge. Classifies findings as validated/speculative/rejected. Uses `background: true` for concurrent per-finding validation.

### Changed
- **session-inspect description**: Added trigger phrases for parsing debug logs and stream-json ("parse debug log", "analyze hook events", "extract hook fires")

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **meta-issue skill**: Fixed label creation order for non-admin users — issue now creates cleanly without label when gh label create fails due to insufficient permissions
- **tp-force-multiplier hook**: Rewrote SessionStart hook with conditional three-gate coaching instead of "all capabilities are mandatory" anti-pattern
- **tp-critic agent**: Commented out cross-plugin dead skill references (fpf, sadd, ddd, tdd, kaizen) for partial-install safety

### Changed
- **10 agent renames**: Dropped `fpf-` and `sadd-` filename prefixes across tp-fpf (4 agents) and tp-sadd (6 agents)
- **sadd JUDGE triggers**: Replaced bare-verb triggers with phrase-level specific ones to resolve routing collisions
- **create-plans skill**: All critic-loop sites now reference MAX_ITERATIONS=3 (per evaluation-protocol.md); vague template paths replaced with explicit `templates/brief.md`
- **execute-plans skill**: All critic-loop sites now bounded by MAX_ITERATIONS (3 for milestone, 2 for pre-execution/per-task); template paths now explicit
- **orchestrate command**: Expanded from 3-line stub to 8-step protocol referencing scratchpad, evaluation-protocol, and subagent-orchestration skill

### Added
- **orchestrate-solo command**: New first-class lightweight mode command — no subagents, no scratchpad, no critic loop; sequential in-context execution for small tasks
- **archive-plan hard precondition**: Phase 1 now enforces SUMMARY.md existence with structured JSON failure signal and --abandoned override path
- **subagent-orchestration routing**: Added --solo/--lightweight decision rules to skill Decision Router

### Removed
- **sadd JUDGE**: 5 bare-verb trigger phrases that caused routing collisions with refine/diagnose/git/create-plans

## [0.12.1] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **`memory-curator` skill** (moved from `tp-vps-governance`): Audits, deduplicates, and archives Claude Code memory files. Modes: AUDIT, DEDUP, ARCHIVE, CLEAN. Includes `scripts/dedup.py` for semantic deduplication via Jaccard similarity.
- **`rules-orchestration` AUDIT mode**: Analyzes CLAUDE.md hierarchy for conflicts, duplications, and cross-file contradictions. Extracted from `config-auditor`.
- **`plan-verifier` agent tools**: Added `Write` and `Edit` to the allowlist for scratchpad-first evaluation protocol compliance.

### Removed
- **`tp-vps-governance` plugin**: Deleted after capability migration to core plugin. `config-auditor` absorbed into `rules-orchestration` AUDIT mode; `memory-curator` moved to `plugins/taches-principled/skills/memory-curator/`.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **`tp-meta` consolidated into single hub skill `session-analytics`**: Merged `meta-issue`, `meta-review`, and `session-inspect` into one skill with INSPECT / REVIEW / ISSUE decision router. Each mode has its own reference file (`references/inspect-reference.md`, `references/review-reference.md`, `references/issue-reference.md`). Commands updated to target the new hub skill. Plugin version bumped to 0.2.0.

### Removed
- **`meta-issue`, `meta-review`, `session-inspect` skills** (3 directories): Superseded by `session-analytics` hub.

## [0.11.1] — 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **Dissolved `scope-work` skill**: The hollow router (`add-task`/`refine-task`/`create-plans` routing) was removed — its three spoke files never existed and its triggers conflicted with `add-task`. Lifecycle skills now self-route via their existing CONTRAST frontmatter. References updated in `ideation`, `archive-plan`, `execute-plans`, and `refine`.
- **`sadd` DESIGN mode merged into `subagent-orchestration`**: Architecture design capability consolidated into the core `subagents` hub. `sadd` now redirects DESIGN to `subagent-orchestration` and focuses on COMPETE/JUDGE/EXECUTE/EXPLORE competitive evaluation. `sadd-architect` agent deleted as orphaned.
- **`kaizen` / `ddd` relationship clarified**: Both skills updated with explicit "Relationship" sections — `kaizen` as continuous design-time guardrails (the immune system), `ddd` as specialist structural analysis (called in for diagnosis). Mutual cross-references added.
- **Shared evaluation protocol extracted**: `execute-plans`, `refine-task`, and `implement-task` now reference `execute-plans/references/evaluation-protocol.md` for the shared judge pattern (chain-of-thought, MAX_ITERATIONS, 5.0/5.0 hallucination guard, scratchpad-first, weighted rubrics). Prevents drift across the three skills.
- **Memory/learnings handoff chain made explicit**: `archive-plan`, `refine` (MEMORIZE mode), and `rules-orchestration` (SYNC mode) now have explicit CONTRAST cross-references documenting the two-writers/one-reader chain feeding `.principled/memory/learnings.md`.

### Removed
- **`scope-work` skill** (4 files): `SKILL.md` + `references/{nano-spec,task-spec,roadmap}.md` — no spoke bodies, routing superseded by direct CONTRAST routing in lifecycle skills.
- **`sadd-architect` agent**: Orphaned when DESIGN mode moved to `subagent-orchestration`.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **scope-work skill** (canonical plugin): Unified entry point for task lifecycle — infers work scale from input and routes to `add-task` (nano-spec), `refine-task` (task-spec), or `create-plans` (roadmap). 261 lines across SKILL.md + 3 references.
- **New official docs**: `docs/official/permissions.md` and `docs/official/plugins/plugins-reference.md` (refreshed from source).

### Changed
- **Skills preloading philosophy — "Better too much than not enough"**: Retired the restrictive rule limiting skill preloading to evaluation/critique agents only. All potentially relevant skills MUST now be preloaded on all agent types (execution, research, explorer, etc.) for deterministic capability access. Properly authored skills use progressive disclosure — baseline context consumption is extremely low (~500 tokens frontmatter + body, references on-demand). AI retains full autonomy to lazy-load deeper reference files based on task requirements. Updated `docs/official/agent-skill-integration.md`, `plugins/taches-principled/skills/subagent-orchestration/SKILL.md`, and CLAUDE.md.

- **Skill file path referencing standardized**: Eradicated `{baseDir}` and `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` variables from all skill bodies and references (12 files). Established two canonical rules: (1) paths resolve within the skill's folder by default, (2) only SKILL.md may cite supporting files — reference files must never cross-cite. Converted all passive citations ("You can read", "See reference") to deterministic IF→BEFORE imperatives. Documented in CLAUDE.md and skill-authoring SKILL.md.
- **Native Tool Referencing standard**: Eradicated hardcoded tool names from orchestration directives across 11 files. `Write tool access` → `write access`, `"use the Read tool"` → `"use your native tools"`, etc. This ensures forward compatibility when the underlying API migrates (e.g., Task→Agent rename). Documented in CLAUDE.md and skill-authoring SKILL.md as a core best practice.
- **CLAUDE.md Skill Discovery**: Rewrote section as "Skill Discovery & Routing Metadata" — explicitly names routing-participant fields (description, when_to_use only), defines the "Metadata-Only Gate" concept, elevates 200-char rule, and adds Anti-Pattern "No Method Leaking" with bad/good examples.
- **Skill descriptions cleaned** (5 skills, jargon → user vocabulary):
  - `diagnose`: "A3, Five Whys, Fishbone, Stack Trace" → "Find root causes of recurring problems, failed fixes, and complex bugs"
  - `security`: "SAST, DEPENDENCY-AUDIT, SECRETS-DETECTION, COMPLIANCE" → "Scan for security vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, and broken authentication patterns"
  - `kaizen`: "YAGNI" → "avoid over-engineering"
  - `plan-do-check-act`: "PDCA cycle" → "Plan a change, try it at small scale, measure results"
  - `tdd`: "Red-Green-Refactor TDD" → "Write tests first, then implementation"
- **Must-do cleanup pass** (commit `55a6ba0`):
  - H1: Removed 2 tracked `.pyc` files; broadened `.gitignore` to `plugins/**/__pycache__/`
  - H2: Fixed broken CONTRAST references to non-existent `rule-propagator`
  - H4: Standardized `tp-force-multiplier` author to "Felix" across all 9 plugins
  - H5: Added `repository`, `license`, `keywords` to all marketplace.json entries
  - M3: Moved `commands-standard.md` to `docs/templates/command.md`
  - M4: Stripped redundant `shell: bash` from 33 files
  - M5: Stripped redundant `user-invocable: true` from 2 files
  - M6: Stripped dead YAML frontmatter from 15 templates/workflows
- **Plugin subagent rename for global uniqueness**: prefixed plugin subagents to avoid collisions when the `Agent` tool resolves across the marketplace:
  - `plugins/taches-principled/skills/create-plans/agents/{architect,explorer,implementer}` → `plan-{architect,explorer,implementer}`
  - `plugins/taches-principled/skills/rules-orchestration/agents/{rules-analyzer,rules-auditor,rules-integrator}` → `transcript-rules-{analyzer,auditor,integrator}`
  - `plugins/tp-sadd/agents/{architect,explorer}` → `sadd-{architect,explorer}`
  - `plugins/taches-principled/agents/implementer` → `global-implementer`
  - `plugins/taches-principled/skills/execute-plans/agents/researcher` → `execute-researcher`
- **README brittleness reduction**:
  - Stripped 4 magic-number count headers (`### 23 Skills`, `### 14 Commands`, `### 13 Agents`, `### 8 Marketplace Plugins`).
  - Collapsed 3 enumeration tables (Skills, Commands, Agents) to 5 curated examples each + filesystem pointers.
  - Fixed unclosed code block fence in "Full Marketplace Setup" (line 110).
  - Added `### README Hygiene` subsection to CLAUDE.md "Before Any Commit" self-check to make the discipline explicit.
- **CLAUDE.md description cap reconciliation**: changed self-check from `≤150 chars` to `≤1,536 chars` (combined `description` + `when_to_use`) to match the official cap per `docs/official/skills.md`.

### Removed
- **Orphan agent files** (untracked, unreferenced, superseded): `global-rules-{analyzer,auditor,integrator}.md` — the `transcript-rules-*` agents in `rules-orchestration/` do this work.
- **Empty directories**: `plugins/taches-principled/rules/`, `plugins/tp-vps-governance/agents/`.
- **Tracked Python bytecode** (2 files in `tp-force-multiplier/hooks/__pycache__/`).
- **Stale `.gitignore` line** referencing the removed `launch-subagent` skill directory.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **tp-meta plugin**: Session meta-review and behavioral analysis plugin with 3 skills, 1 agent, and 3 commands.
  - `session-inspect` skill: parses Claude Code session transcripts (JSONL) into structured data — tool calls, errors, cost, loaded plugins, behavioral events.
  - `meta-review` skill: reviews sessions for behavioral anti-patterns, investigates root causes with parallel subagent fan-out, and produces scoped findings.
  - `meta-issue` skill: creates GitHub issues from meta-review findings, sanitized for public sharing with privacy audit gate.
  - `meta-reviewer` agent: diagnostic agent that reads JSONL transcripts and identifies tool misuse, skipped verifications, and instruction-following failures with root cause scoping (PLUGIN/USER-FILE/ENVIRONMENT/MODEL).

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added
- **tp-force-multiplier plugin**: Hook-driven coaching plugin that steers Claude to use subagents and skills more via real-time semantic coaching. Three hooks: SessionStart (lightweight hint), Stop (pattern detection with 5+ tools), PostCompact (pre-pressure reminder). No tool injection, zero blocking, semantic patterns only.
- **CLAUDE.md rules**: Added 4 new rules for instruction clarity
  - Deterministic Language for Execution Rules (strong vs soft language calibration)
  - Infrastructure Assumption Rule (verify prerequisites before dependent operations)

  - Agent Tool Contract Rule (tools must match stated capabilities)

### Changed
- **references/official/**: Updated hooks.md, skills.md, subagents.md, commands.md, and marketplaces.md with marketplace conventions (effort/effort field, shell: bash, hub skills, {baseDir} syntax, CONTRAST sections, maxTurns:15, memory:local, canonical spawn vocab, command format)

### Changed
- **Lifecycle hints removed**: Removed soft-orchestration lifecycle hints from add-task, create-prompts, implement-task per debate WEAK verdict — CONTRAST sections and decision routers are sufficient for routing

- **Routing BLOCKERs** (3): Removed overlapping trigger phrases causing routing conflicts
  - refine-task: removed "plan this out", "/plan", "make this actionable", "break this down into steps"
  - execute-plans: removed "execute" from description and when_to_use
- **Failure signal BLOCKERs** (2): Added missing Failure Signal sections
  - ideation: added no-viable-options/user-abandoned/scope-too-broad failure modes
  - claude-headless: added session-timeout/permission-denied/tool-unavailable failure modes
- **Git availability**: Added `git --version` checks to implement-task and refine-task
- **Judge tool mismatch**: Added Write tool to judge.md for filesystem communication
- **TDD Iron Law contradiction**: Removed "write tests" from TDD triggers (Iron Law forbids without failing test first)
- **tp-force-multiplier hooks**: Fixed prescriptive language → advisory ("Pattern: X suggests Y")
- **tp-sadd agent tools**: Added Bash to meta-judge/judge, removed unused Edit from generator
- **create-plans/agents**: Added missing spawn footer to implementer

### Changed
- **METHOD over-specification** (249 lines removed across 4 skills):
  - fpf: 7-step procedure → principle statements
  - diagnose: A3/Five Whys/Fishbone condensed
  - create-plans: 11-item fan-out → 4 principles
