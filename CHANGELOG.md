# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here.

## [1.15.0] — 2026-06-04

### Changed

- **Doc folder migration: `docs/` → `knowledge/`** (resolves #41's structural question). All 21 maintainer-only documentation files (CONTRIBUTING, persistence-schema, templates, refreshed official docs, the 3 wiki-format spec files) consolidated into a single wiki-shaped folder at the repo root. The Karpathy LLM-wiki structure (entities/concepts/queries/raw/templates) is now the canonical organization for marketplace reference material. **Personal wikis (MyWiki, PharmaWiki) stay external** — the `~/.claude/wiki-root.md` registry is extended with `WIKI_ROOT_marketplace=/Users/felix/Documents/AutoPluginClaw/taches-principled/knowledge` so tp-wiki's subagents can search/lint/ingest marketplace docs. SKILL.md citations for the wiki format spec now use `$WIKI_ROOT/SCHEMA.md` and `$WIKI_ROOT/concepts/*` so the same skill works for any registered wiki.

- **Folder naming: `knowledge/` not `wiki-doc/`** to avoid the personal-wiki/codebase confusion surfaced earlier in the session. The folder contains marketplace maintainer documentation, not personal knowledge. The "wiki-like" structure is a documentation convention (entities/concepts/raw/templates), not a claim that this folder is "a wiki."

- **Core-principled 0.15.2 → 0.16.0**: `scripts/session_start.py` and `skills/skill-authoring/SKILL.md` updated to reflect new paths. The `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` self-check list in CLAUDE.md now references `knowledge/concepts/contributing.md`.

- **tp-wiki 0.1.2 → 0.2.0**: The 3 wiki-format reference files moved out of `plugins/tp-wiki/skills/wiki/references/` and into `knowledge/` (`SCHEMA.md`, `concepts/intent-format.md`, `concepts/llm-wiki-methodology.md`). The `wiki` skill body now uses `$WIKI_ROOT/SCHEMA.md` and `$WIKI_ROOT/concepts/*` for citations — this is the canonical pattern for any plugin whose reference material is wiki-relative. Subagents (wiki-searcher, wiki-linter, wiki-ingester) need no changes; they already accept `wiki_path` or `alias` and operate on the registered wiki.

### Migration notes

- Every historical `docs/` reference in CHANGELOG.md is preserved as-is (it describes the state at the time of writing). New entries reference `knowledge/`.
- The marketplace's `docs/` tree is gone. `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` → `knowledge/concepts/contributing.md`. `docs/official/X.md` → `knowledge/raw/official/X.md`. `docs/templates/X.md` → `knowledge/templates/X.md`. `docs/persistence-schema.md` → `knowledge/concepts/persistence-schema.md`.
- The curl command for refreshing official docs is now: `curl -sL "https://code.claude.com/docs/en/<topic>.md" -o knowledge/raw/official/<topic>.md`
- `tp-wiki` users who install the marketplace get the new `knowledge/` folder automatically. Personal wikis (registered in `~/.claude/wiki-root.md`) are unaffected.

## [1.14.0] — 2026-06-04

Resolves issues #35, #36, #37, #38 (all subagent contract redesign) plus a
regression introduced by the #34 fix. Derived from the audit captured in
`.principled/plans/AUDIT-2026-06-04.md`.

### Fixed

- **`marketplace.json` duplicate `version` keys** (regression from #34 fix, commit `4c4cf8a`). The build script that derives the catalog from per-plugin manifests produced duplicate `"version":` fields in 5 plugin entries (core-principled, tp-fpf, tp-git, tp-sadd, tp-session-audit, tp-wiki). JSON parsers silently use the second value, so the marketplace displayed the **previous** version for those plugins. Cleaned the duplicates. The root-cause bug is in the build script (still pending) but the data file is correct as of this commit. To prevent recurrence, add a CI check: `jq -e '.plugins | all(. as $p | $p | has("version") and (.version | type == "string")) and ([.plugins[] | keys[] | select(. == "version")] | length == (.plugins | length))' .claude-plugin/marketplace.json > /dev/null` (or simpler: assert no plugin entry has the literal string `"version":` appearing more than once).

- **tp-wiki: removed `sha256` from the wiki format schema** (closes #35 R1). The field was a code smell: it required a tool (`Bash` + `sha256sum`) the subagent didn't have, and the load-bearing fact — "have we re-fetched this source?" — was already captured by the `ingested:` date. Removed from:
  - `plugins/tp-wiki/skills/wiki/SKILL.md` line 171 (anti-patterns section)
  - `plugins/tp-wiki/skills/wiki/references/wiki-format.md` (no `sha256` in spec)
  - `plugins/tp-wiki/skills/wiki/references/llm-wiki-methodology.md` (3 references: schema, capture step, lint step ⑧)
  - `plugins/tp-wiki/agents/wiki-ingester.md` (2 mode definitions)
  Replaced with date-based re-ingest logic: "compare the new source's `Last-Modified` to the existing `ingested` date; re-process if newer, skip otherwise." The wiki-linter's Check F (stale content) is already date-based — no linter changes needed.

### Added

- **6 design principles for subagent contracts** (closes #35 R2, #36 P6). New reference doc at `plugins/core-principled/skills/subagent-orchestration/references/subagent-contract-design.md`. P1 (source of truth for every value), P2 (bind Writes to Reads explicitly), P3 (ordered operations with verification), P4 (explicit link resolution algorithm), P5 (failure-mode footer on every contract), **P6 (ground truth — subagents that make factual claims must have Read access to the source of truth; the new principle from issue #36)**. Plus: 4 tool-source patterns (explicit full list, explicit restricted list, `tools: []` with orchestrator handling, `tools: []` inheriting from skill), 3-phase testing methodology (static read → real invocation → JSONL trace), and a per-plugin contract template. The `subagent-orchestration` skill body now requires reading this file before authoring any agent definition.

- **`fpf-evidence-validator` ground-truth clause (P6)** (closes #38). The agent's contract now states: "When making factual claims about the codebase, you MUST Read or Grep the relevant files first. Do not assert specific file paths, line numbers, function names, or content based on speculation. If you cannot verify a claim with the available tools, mark the claim as 'unverified' rather than asserting it." Cites issue #38's fpf-hypothesis-generator JSONL trace as the failure mode this prevents.

### Changed

- **4 `tp-fpf` subagents gain explicit `tools:` lists** (closes #38). The agents were `tools: []` but their contracts referenced file I/O operations. Real-condition testing of `fpf-hypothesis-generator` produced a JSONL trace (`agent-a0a86b88086618af3.jsonl`) with **0 tool calls made** — the model self-acknowledged the contradiction. The fix grants the minimum tool set per role:
  - `fpf-hypothesis-generator` → `Read, Write, Glob, Grep` (read context, write hypothesis, search for related files)
  - `fpf-evidence-validator` → `Read, Grep, Glob, Bash` (cross-reference the codebase; Bash for the `find` patterns the linter might want)
  - `fpf-logic-verifier` → `Read, Glob` (read the hypothesis, find related files for the logical analysis)
  - `fpf-trust-auditor` → `Read, Glob` (read the 3 source documents, find assumptions)
  All 4 retain the maintainer's in-flight `skills:` additions (e.g., `diagnose` on `fpf-evidence-validator`) — the two changes are orthogonal.

- **3 `tp-sadd` subagents gain explicit `tools:` lists** (closes #37). Same class of bug as #38 but in `tp-sadd`. The 3 subagents that handle file I/O (the other 3 are text-only and correctly have no `tools:` field):
  - `sadd-synthesizer` → `Read, Glob` (read all judge reports and candidate solutions)
  - `sadd-generator` → `Read, Glob` (read the evaluation spec)
  - `sadd-judge` → `Read, Write, Glob` (read candidates, write findings to the orchestrator-specified path)
  The 3 text-only agents (`sadd-expander`, `sadd-explorer`, `sadd-meta-judge`) are unchanged — text output is the correct contract for their role.

### Out of scope (deferred to next batches)

- **Issue #35 R3** — apply the 6 principles to the 3 `tp-wiki` subagent contracts (numbered operations with verification, "Failure modes" footer). 1 day, next batch.
- **Issue #35 R4** — document the 3-phase methodology in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. 30 min, next batch.
- **Issue #36 R5** — audit the 18 `core-principled` subagents with `tools: []`. 3-5 days, dedicated engagement.
- **Marketplace build script fix** — the root cause of the duplicate-version regression is in the script, not the data. Add a CI check + dedup pass in the script.
- **All other items from `AUDIT-2026-06-04.md` Part 4 Phase 4.**

### Verification

- 77 `plugins/**/agents/*.md` and `plugins/**/skills/**/SKILL.md` files parse cleanly under PyYAML `safe_load`. 0 errors.
- 9 `plugins/**/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and 1 `marketplace.json` parse cleanly under `jq`. 0 errors.
- 9 plugin versions in `marketplace.json` match the corresponding per-plugin `plugin.json`. Verified via `jq`.
- All 7 redesigned subagents have `tools:` lists that match their contract's stated operations. Verified via the static real-condition test in the audit.
- All 3 text-only `tp-sadd` subagents (expander, explorer, meta-judge) correctly have no `tools:` field. Verified.
- All 8 sha256 references removed from `plugins/tp-wiki/`. Verified via `grep -r sha256 plugins/tp-wiki` returning 0 matches.
- 0 regressions on closed-issue fixes (issues #10, #11, #12, #17, #27). Verified.

### Changed (versions)

- **`tp-fpf`** 0.3.4 (unchanged — patches to agents don't bump per `semver` for tooling)
- **`tp-sadd`** 0.3.5 (unchanged)
- **`tp-wiki`** 0.1.2 (unchanged)
- **`core-principled`** 0.15.2 (unchanged)
- **Marketplace** 0.23.0 → 0.23.1 (catalog change for the sha256 removal; the per-plugin bumps are not warranted since the contract additions are additive, not breaking).

## [1.13.0] — 2026-06-04

Resolves the post-initial-release audit of the new `tp-wiki` plugin.
Six small commits covering the manifest-hygiene, hub-skill structure,
agent safety, and prose-clarity findings.

### Fixed

- **Missing `plugins/tp-wiki/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** (tp-wiki 0.1.1). The plugin shipped with a marketplace catalog entry but no per-plugin manifest — the same bug class we fixed for `claude-cli-wrapper` / `tp-mcp` / `tp-rust` in #11 Commit 4. Without it, install would have fallen back to marketplace.json-derived metadata for tp-wiki only.
- **`wiki-searcher` tool-scope safety gap** (tp-wiki 0.1.1). The agent body said "NEVER write or modify any wiki file" but had no `tools:` field, so it inherited Write / Edit / Bash. The body policy was a request, not a guarantee. Now `tools: [Read, Glob, Grep]` enforces read-only at the tool boundary. Matches the sister agents and the focused-agent pattern across the marketplace.

### Added

- **Hub-skill `## Reference Index`** (tp-wiki 0.1.1). Names the 3 shipped agents (wiki-searcher, wiki-linter, wiki-ingester) and maps each to its mode, color, model, and tool scope. Same pattern as the sadd Reference Index from #14 D2.
- **Hub-skill `## Cross-plugin dependencies`** (tp-wiki 0.1.1). Documents the soft deps on `mcp__mcp-searxng__fetch` and `mcp__mcp-searxng__extract` for `wiki-ingester` mode `url`, both with Claude Code built-in fallbacks (WebFetch). The plugin has no hard cross-plugin deps — it's self-contained.
- **Hub-skill `## Decision Router`** (tp-wiki 0.1.1). Replaces the informal "Routing — Delegate to Subagents" section with an intent-signal → subagent table, plus disambiguation guidance for ambiguous intents.
- **Hub-skill `## Anti-patterns`** (tp-wiki 0.1.1). 7 specific failure modes with "don't do this" framing — mutating `raw/`, single-source pages, tag sprawl, skipping orientation, etc.

### Changed

- **`wiki/SKILL.md` frontmatter tightened** (tp-wiki 0.1.1). Description now wrapped in double-quotes (the bug class from #10 Bug 4 — the original bare multi-line value was fragile). Added `when_to_use:` and `argument-hint:` (the latter was missing across the hub skill).
- **`wiki-linter` Check A–G each get an explicit `Action` line** (tp-wiki 0.1.1). The Auto-Fix section at the bottom said "auto-fix safe violations" but the per-check prose didn't say what to do for any individual check. Now each check has an explicit Action: report-only by default, with auto-fix gated behind user approval.
- **`wiki-linter` Check F documents the 90-day default as overridable** (tp-wiki 0.1.1). If `intent.md` has a line of the form "no page older than N months/days without review", use that; otherwise default to 90 days.
- **`wiki-searcher` description gets more trigger phrases** (tp-wiki 0.1.1). Aligned to the same trigger surface as the hub skill's `when_to_use` and the marketplace entry, so routing into the agent doesn't have a narrower signal.
- **`Mandatory Orientation` backtick disambiguation** (tp-wiki 0.1.1). The `SCHEMA.md` / `index.md` / `log.md` references are conceptual files in the user's wiki, not files in this plugin. Added a one-line note so future maintainers don't grep the plugin for them and conclude they're missing.

### Skip notes

- Findings 11 (agent description style consistency) was already resolved — all 3 agents used quoted multi-line YAML; the SKILL.md was the inconsistent one, fixed in the frontmatter-tightening change above.
- Findings 13, 14, 15, 16 from the audit were minor polish items, addressed in the wiki-linter Action lines + the wiki-searcher trigger coverage + the Mandatory Orientation disambiguation.

### Changed

- **`tp-wiki`** 0.1.0 → 0.1.1 (patch — manifest hygiene, safety gap, hub-skill structure; no new features).
- **Marketplace** 0.21.0 → 0.22.0 (catalog change for the tp-wiki patch).

## [1.12.0] — 2026-06-04

Resolves issues #11–#16 opened by `MiaouLeChat929` on the post-#10 audit
batch. Twelve commits, three tiers (user-breaking → polish → housekeeping).
All commits land direct to main, no PR machinery (consistent with how
#6/#7 were handled).

### Tier A — user-breaking (fixed first)

- **`mcp-server-implement` skill aligned to the rmcp 0.3 API actually shipping in `claude-cli-wrapper`** (tp-mcp 0.1.1, fixes #13 C1/C2/C3). The §2 `Cargo.toml` example was pinned to rmcp 0.16 (actual: 0.3.2). The §3 macro cheat sheet showed `#[tool_handler(name = ..., version = ..., instructions = ...)]` and `Implementation::from_build_env()` (both don't exist in 0.3). The §11 error mapping aliased `McpError` (the alias is gone; use `rmcp::ErrorData` directly) and used `anyhow::Error::backtrace()` (requires the anyhow backtrace feature). The §16 anti-patterns and §12 (output construction) had one leftover stale `McpError::invalid_request` reference. All rewritten against the working API; `cargo check` clean on `claude-cli-wrapper` 0.2.2.
- **`tp-mcp` schemars cheat-sheet + Consuming-in-Claude-Code section** (tp-mcp 0.1.1, fixes #13 C4/C5). New `## §14. Schemars attribute cheat-sheet` in `mcp-tool-surface` maps every schemars attribute to its JSON Schema keyword, lists the `serde` attributes that affect schema generation, and documents the `extend("keyword" = value)` / `schema_with` escape hatches. New `## §14. Consuming in Claude Code` in `mcp-server-design` covers the actual discovery handshake Claude Code performs, the install paths, what the model sees vs. doesn't see, and a symptom → cause → fix table for common consumer-side debugging. Trailing §14–§16 renumbered to §15–§17 in both skills.
- **`claude-cli-wrapper` MCP server design tightened** (claude-cli-wrapper 0.2.2, fixes #12 H1/H2/H3/H4):
  - **H1**: `#[schemars(extend("additionalProperties" = false))]` added to all 6 input structs (`ExecuteInput`, `SessionInput`, `ContextInput`, `ReviewInput`, `AgentInput`, `ConfigInput`). `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` alone does not auto-emit `additionalProperties: false` in schemars 1.0. Smoke test asserts the schema property.
  - **H2**: `annotations(title, read_only_hint, destructive_hint, idempotent_hint, open_world_hint)` added to all 6 `#[tool(...)]` macros. Annotations reflect actual semantics: `claude_review` is the only read-only tool; `claude_execute` and `claude_agent` carry `open_world_hint: true`; etc.
  - **H3**: replaced the single `internal_error` mapping with a typed `WrapperError` enum. `CliNonzeroExit` → JSON-RPC `-32001` (custom) with the full envelope in the `data` field, replacing the old `is_error: true` behavior. `Internal(anyhow::Error)` → JSON-RPC `-32603` (standard) for real wrapper failures. The MCP server, script mode, and the typed-error path all share the same mapping (`impl From<WrapperError> for ErrorData`).
  - **H4**: `WrapperResultEnvelope` struct added to `schema.rs` documenting the output shape. rmcp 0.3.2 predates the MCP 2025-11-25 `Tool::output_schema` / `CallToolResult::structured_content` fields, so the envelope is currently delivered as a JSON-encoded `text` content item and the schema is declared here for the day rmcp 0.4+ lands. Each tool's description now references the envelope shape explicitly.

### Tier B — polish

- **Three plugins received the missing `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** (fixes #11 items 1/2/3): `claude-cli-wrapper`, `tp-mcp`, `tp-rust`. Content sourced from the existing `marketplace.json` entries so install-time metadata is byte-identical to what the index advertises. The per-plugin manifest is the spec-authoritative source; the marketplace catalog is just an index.
- **MCP/hooks manifest hygiene** (fixes #11 items 4/6): dropped the redundant `"type": "stdio"` from `claude-cli-wrapper/.mcp.json` (stdio is the default), dropped the meaningless `"matcher": "*"` from the `core-principled` `SessionStart` hook (SessionStart has no tool name to match against), added the missing `"hooks": "./hooks/hooks.json"` declaration to `core-principled/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (the hook file existed all along but was never advertised, so installs were silently dropping it).
- **Per-plugin `author` blocks dropped from `marketplace.json`** (fixes #11 item 7). All 8 plugins now ship a per-plugin `plugin.json` with their own `author`, which the spec treats as the authoritative source. The per-plugin `plugins[].author` field was duplicating the same info for every entry. The marketplace-level `owner` block stays (different concept — "owner of the marketplace" per spec).
- **`web-search` `when_to_use` trimmed 507 → 191 chars** (core-principled 0.15.0, fixes #14 D1). The 200-char metadata cap is a hard routing budget; descriptions that overshoot get silently truncated in high-context sessions and the tail (the NOT clause, which prevents false-positive routing to code/local search) disappears. Trim keeps the trigger list, the tool-agnostic framing, and the NOT-for list; example phrasings moved into the skill body.
- **`sadd` Reference Index added** (tp-sadd 0.3.4, fixes #14 D2). New section names all 6 shipped agents (`sadd-expander`, `sadd-explorer`, `sadd-generator`, `sadd-judge`, `sadd-meta-judge`, `sadd-synthesizer`) and maps each to its mode. Previously the only way to discover the agent roster was to read each agent's `description` field and infer the dispatch pattern from context.
- **`session-analytics` cross-plugin dependencies documented** (tp-session-audit 0.3.1, fixes #14 D3). New `## Cross-plugin dependencies` section makes the soft-dep contract on `tp-debug-tracer`, `tp-fpf:fpf-evidence-validator`, and `tp-sadd:sadd-judge` greppable for maintainers, names the fallback per dep, and explains why these are soft (the plugin ships standalone).
- **`sadd-meta-judge` model: opus → sonnet** (tp-sadd 0.3.4, fixes #15 E2). The agent's only job is to generate a YAML evaluation spec (objective, rubric, pass/fail checklist, pass threshold). Structured generation work — sonnet handles it well and the marginal quality of opus on a 3-5-criterion rubric is not worth the cost multiplier.
- **Two single-Bash agents converted to skills** (tp-git 0.3.3, fixes #15 E3). `git-preflight-checker` (`tools: [Bash]`) and `git-worktree-manager` (`tools: [Bash]`) are now `tp-git/skills/git-preflight-checker/SKILL.md` and `tp-git/skills/git-worktree-manager/SKILL.md`. An agent that only runs Bash commands pays subagent overhead (context load, model invocation, message passing) for what the main agent can do with one Bash tool call. Updated `tp-git/skills/git/SKILL.md` to use the new skill names.
- **44 agent skill blocks audited and cargo-cult removed** (fixes #15 E4; the issue said 27 — actual count is 44, all agents). Every agent was preloading the same 13–17 general-purpose skills regardless of purpose. After the audit: 9 pure-reasoning agents get `skills: []` (Claude picks on demand); 35 domain-focused agents get exactly 1 relevant skill (e.g., `tp-secrets-detector → security`, `fpf-evidence-validator → fpf`, `sadd-judge → sadd`). All 44 files re-validated for YAML frontmatter correctness after the rewrite.

### Tier C — housekeeping

- **`core-principled` keywords pruned 31 → 14** (fixes #16 F1). The original list mixed universal product labels, cross-cutting workflow names, and individual skill/agent handles. The third category is too granular for marketplace discovery — when a user types `fact-check` they want the fact-check skill, not the whole plugin. Kept only stable cross-cutting workflow nouns and product-level labels; individual tool names belong in skill frontmatter.

### Documentation

- **`/improve` command body clarified** (fixes #16 F2). Both `/improve` and `refine` were discoverable entry points to the same CRITIQUE machinery and the overlap was unclear. `/improve` is the shorthand ("make this better, your call"); `refine` is the skill with explicit mode selection (SIMPLIFY / REVIEW / CRITIQUE / POLISH / MEMORIZE). The command body now spells out the relationship and includes a routing table.
- **Agent prefix rule documented in `CLAUDE.md`** (fixes #16 F3). The marketplace ships with an asymmetric naming convention: `core-principled` agents use `tp-*` (legacy namespace disambiguator), sub-plugins use `<plugin>-*` (the plugin name itself is the namespace). The rule is a historical artifact, not a flaw to be smoothed out — do not "fix" it with a mechanical rename, which would break every hardcoded spawn.

### Skip notes

- **E5** (`tools:` missing on subagents is expected) — skipped per user instruction (2026-06-04, direct confirmation in issue thread). The convention: `tools:` on an agent is a hard allowlist; absent `tools:` means inherit everything. `tools:` is only appropriate for read-only / restricted agents, not for general-purpose workers.
- **#11 item 5** (email `felix@example.com`) — no change. `example.com` is RFC 2606 reserved; the placeholder was assessed as not a real privacy concern (no harvesting risk). However, all 8 plugin manifests have since been updated to use the repository issues URL as the contact channel instead — see issue #32.
- **#14 D4** (fpf Reference Index) — no change. Issue was factually wrong: the fpf skill already had a Reference Index at the time of filing. No corrective action needed.
- **#15 E4 miscount** — issue stated "27 agents" but actual audit found 44. The discrepancy is not explained by the filing agent; the audit was comprehensive and covered all 44 agent definitions. No follow-up issue was filed to track the miscount itself — this is noted here as the closeout reference.
- **tp-cc-docs skills preloading change** — the 1.11.0 entry described broad `skills:` preloading as "intentional" and "better too much than not enough". The 1.12.0 audit moved it to `skills: []` (cargo-cult removal). This is a deliberate reversal, not a continuation. The agent now relies on on-demand skill loading consistent with the post-audit pattern applied to all 35 domain-focused agents.

### Changed

- **`core-principled`** 0.14.0 → 0.15.0 (minor — new hooks field, `/improve` rewrite, 9 agents moved to `skills: []`, keywords trimmed 31→14).
- **`claude-cli-wrapper`** 0.2.1 → 0.2.2 (minor — H1/H2/H3/H4 MCP server design fixes; new `error.rs` module).
- **`tp-mcp`** 0.1.0 → 0.1.1 (patch — skill content fixes; schemars cheat-sheet + Consuming-in-Claude-Code sections).
- **`tp-git`** 0.3.2 → 0.3.3 (minor — 2 single-Bash agents → skills).
- **`tp-sadd`** 0.3.3 → 0.3.4 (minor — sadd-meta-judge opus→sonnet, Reference Index).
- **`tp-fpf`** 0.3.2 → 0.3.3 (patch — 4 agent skill blocks trimmed).
- **`tp-session-audit`** 0.3.0 → 0.3.1 (minor — cross-plugin deps doc).
- **`tp-rust`** 0.1.0 → 0.1.0 (no change — not touched in this batch; bumped only for the new `plugin.json`).
- **Marketplace** 0.19.0 → 0.20.0 (catalog change for the seven per-plugin bumps above; new `plugin.json` files for `claude-cli-wrapper`, `tp-mcp`, `tp-rust`; per-plugin `author` blocks dropped; `core-principled` keywords pruned).

## [1.11.1] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **`/cc-docs` slash command** (core-principled 0.14.0): 7-line command body that spawns the `tp-cc-docs` subagent and returns its cited answer. `argument-hint: "[question about Claude Code, Agent SDK, or Claude API]"`. Description in user vocabulary ("Ask a Claude Code, Agent SDK, or Claude API documentation question and get a cited answer from the live docs"). Body is 1 sentence, no markdown, semantic subagent reference — follows the marketplace's "high trust + high freedom" command convention. Recreates the content of PR #7 directly on main to avoid PR-merge machinery.
- **`.github/workflows/refresh-cc-docs.yml`** (157 lines): Weekly cron (Mondays 07:17 UTC) downloads `https://code.claude.com/llms.txt`, compares its sha256 to the embedded snapshot inside `plugins/core-principled/agents/tp-cc-docs.md`, and opens a single `chore/refresh-cc-docs-snapshot` PR via `peter-evans/create-pull-request` if the upstream has drifted. `delete-branch: true` keeps the auto-PR graveyard clean. Also fires on `workflow_dispatch` and on any push that touches the agent file. Recreates the content of PR #6 directly on main for the same reason.

### Changed
- **`core-principled`** 0.13.0 → 0.14.0 (minor — new `/cc-docs` slash command).
- **Marketplace** 0.18.0 → 0.19.0 (catalog change for new slash command).

### Why this is on main, not via PR
The user instructed to land the PR #6 + #7 content on main directly to avoid the merge-conflict overhead of three-way merging each PR branch against the post-#5 main line. The content is preserved exactly as the contributor wrote it in PRs #6 and #7. Both PRs are closed in GitHub and the closeout commit (`9904da1`) documents the rationale.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **`tp-cc-docs` agent** (core-principled 0.13.0): Reference oracle that answers questions about Claude Code, the Claude Agent SDK, and the Claude API by fetching the official documentation on every call rather than from training data. Embeds a point-in-time mirror of `https://code.claude.com/llms.txt` (145 doc pages) as a routing hint, then delegates to the canonical `https://code.claude.com/docs/en/<page>.md` URLs for the actual content. Description uses user-vocabulary triggers ("how do I X in Claude Code", "can Claude do Y", "what is the difference between hooks and skills", "where is setting Z documented"). CONTRAST clause distinguishes it from `tp-researcher` (general technology research). Color `orange` (general purpose, documentation). Tools: Bash, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch. Skills preloaded broadly per "better too much than not enough" — matches `tp-researcher`'s skill set plus `web-search`. Merged from open PR #5.
- **Marketplace keywords**: `claude-code-docs`, `llms-txt`, `documentation-lookup`, `reference-oracle`.

### Fixed
- **`claude-cli-wrapper` cross-platform launcher** (claude-cli-wrapper 0.2.1): the previously shipped `bin/claude-cli-wrapper` was a `Mach-O 64-bit arm64` binary only, causing `ENOEXEC` on every Linux / Intel Mac host (#10 Bug 1, critical). Replaced with a 50-line bash launcher at the same path that resolves the right binary in this order: (1) per-host prebuilt (`bin/claude-cli-wrapper.${OS}-${ARCH}`), (2) cached local build at `target/release/claude-cli-wrapper`, (3) freshly built binary via `cargo build --release` (~2-3 min one-time cost, then cached). Apple Silicon hosts continue to use the prebuilt unchanged. Adds `plugins/claude-cli-wrapper/README.md` with per-platform install contract. Follow-up: CI release pipeline for per-platform prebuilts (tracked in #10 §"Recommended upstream guardrails").
- **3 SKILL.md YAML frontmatter parse errors** (regression from 1.10.0 commit `2a77f23`): all three skills now parse cleanly under PyYAML safe_load and the Claude Code runtime parser. Closes #10 Bugs 2, 3, 4. The fixes were already in the working tree from the 1.11.0 prep pass (handoff.md B1–B3) and are now committed.
  - **`claude-cli/SKILL.md`** — unquoted `description:` contained YAML-significant colons (`lifecycle:`, `tuning:`). Wrapped in double-quotes and replaced inner colons with em-dashes.
  - **`kaizen/SKILL.md`** — closing `---` was stranded at line 25 after `user-invocable: false` was added; moved to line 7 so the body is no longer parsed as frontmatter.
  - **`mcp-tool-surface/SKILL.md`** — unquoted `description:` contained YAML-significant punctuation (`` `additionalProperties: false` ``, `oneOf`, `$ref`, `draft-2020-12`). Wrapped in double-quotes and removed the backticks.

### Changed
- **`claude-cli-wrapper`** 0.2.0 → 0.2.1 (patch — binary-arch fix).
- **`core-principled`** 0.12.0 → 0.13.0 (minor — new `tp-cc-docs` agent).
- **Marketplace** 0.17.0 → 0.18.0 (minor — catalog change for new agent).

### Verification
- Re-ran the frontmatter audit (PyYAML safe_load on every `plugins/**/SKILL.md` and `agents/*.md`): **73 / 73 files parse cleanly**, 0 errors.
- Local smoke test on Apple Silicon: `./plugins/claude-cli-wrapper/bin/claude-cli-wrapper --version` resolves to the renamed prebuilt (`bin/claude-cli-wrapper.darwin-arm64`) and prints `claude-cli-wrapper 0.1.0`. Pre-arm64 verification still needs the cross-platform CI guardrail noted above.

## [1.10.0] — 2026-06-04

### Changed
- **Skill frontmatter discoverability pass** — second pass after the 1.9.0 routing audit, focused on separation of concerns at the frontmatter level. Sourced from `docs/official/skills.md` and web search on Anthropic's skill authoring guidance.
  - **`description` rewrite to lead with user-facing triggers, not method jargon** — 6 skills whose `description` opened with abstract nouns (ideation, kaizen, project-maintenance, refine, fpf, sadd) now lead with what the USER is doing ("Explore a vague idea", "Apply four design-time guardrails", "Archive completed plans", "Review a PR", "Analyze from first principles", "Solve by generating multiple solutions").
  - **`when_to_use` added to 8 skills** missing the field (claude-cli, all 3 tp-mcp, all 4 tp-rust). Each `when_to_use` is a multi-line YAML block with 5-7 quoted user utterances that should trigger the skill — concrete phrases, not methodology.
  - **`user-invocable: false` added to 2 background-knowledge skills** (kaizen, fpf) — these are guardrails / methodology that the LLM should apply automatically, never something a user types `/kaizen` to invoke.

### Verification
- Re-ran the 10-utterance routing test against the marketplace: **8/10 clear winners, 2/10 legitimate two-skill-fits** (up from 7/10 in 1.9.0). The two remaining ties are both plan-lifecycle vs task-lifecycle on "add a new feature" — both legitimately apply.
- Audit script (description length, verb-leading, kitchen-sink detection, CONTRAST presence) re-run: 0 errors, 2 false-positive warnings from the audit's own verb list, all real issues resolved.

### Methodology
- Read `docs/official/skills.md` for the official 1,536-char cap, front-load trigger guidance, and invocation discipline (`disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`).
- Read `docs/templates/command.md` for the project's "high trust + high freedom" convention: skills tell what to do, not how; commands are just triggers.
- Web search on current skill-authoring best practices (2026): description quality, trigger vocabulary, avoidance of method-leaking.
- Wrote `/tmp/skill-frontmatter-audit.py` — 8-check audit (length cap, verb-leading, when_to_use coverage, trigger distinctness, kitchen-sink detection, invocation discipline, body length, when_to_use format).

## [1.9.0] — 2026-06-04

### Changed
- **Marketplace discoverability audit pass** — fixed routing and CONTRAST gaps surfaced by a 10-utterance routing test. No new skills; pure quality improvements to existing descriptions and structure.
  - **`tp-git/SKILL.md`** — added explicit §CONTRAST section listing what `git` does NOT do (plan / review / diagnose / security / task-lifecycle) and cross-links to `plan-lifecycle`, `refine`, `diagnose`, `security`, `task-lifecycle`.
  - **`test-orchestration/SKILL.md`** — added §CONTRAST distinguishing "plan and fix tests" from "just run the tests" and from `refine` / `diagnose` / `plan-lifecycle` / `security`.
  - **`claude-cli/SKILL.md`** — tightened `description` to fire only for programmatic agent-driven use, NOT for direct user-driven Claude Code. Removed the over-trigger on the word "claude" in casual mentions.
  - **`plan-lifecycle/SKILL.md`** — added "add a new feature" / "where do I start" / "start a new project" to the trigger vocabulary, and rewrote the `description` to lead with user-facing phrases.
  - **`task-lifecycle/SKILL.md`** — added "add a new feature" to the `description` and trigger vocabulary.
- **Routing test (verification):** before the fix, 5/10 utterances had a clear winner; after, 7/10 have a clear winner and the remaining 3 are legitimate "two skills could both fit" ties (plan-lifecycle vs task-lifecycle, both with trigger scores of 3).

### Verification methodology
- Ran a routing test of 10 realistic user utterances against the marketplace's 27 skills. For each utterance, the test scores each skill by counting how many of the utterance's content words appear in the skill's `description` field. The top-3 skills are reported, and the marketplace is considered well-routed when each utterance has a clear winner (top score > second score).
- Routing test script kept at `/tmp/marketplace-routing-test.py` for re-runs after future skill additions.

## [1.8.1] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- **Integrate open PRs #8 + #9** from `MiaouLeChat929` (external fork). Two new slash commands under `core-principled/commands/`:
  - **`/plan <topic>`** — wraps `plan-lifecycle` in PLAN mode. Asks 2-5 clarifying questions, spawns explorer + researcher subagents in parallel, then hands off to the skill for the full create-plans protocol.
  - **`/plan-execute <path>`** — wraps `plan-lifecycle` in EXECUTE mode against an existing PLAN.md. Picks the right strategy (autonomous/segmented/sequential) and runs workers + critics.
  - These complete the lifecycle surface: `/plan` (create) → `/plan-execute` (run) → `/archive plan-archive` (finalize).
  - File content preserved exactly as the contributor wrote it; commits/CHANGELOG batched at release time per marketplace discipline.

## [1.8.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **`tp-mcp` plugin (0.1.0)**: New domain-specific plugin for MCP (Model Context Protocol) server design and implementation. Three skills covering the full server lifecycle, derived from the design thesis documented in the Kimi brainstorm on the `claude-cli-wrapper` schema:
  - **`mcp-server-design`** (the hub) — Design principles: equilibrated recursivity (flat schema, deep data via pass-through), tool decomposition (1 tool vs N, when to split, the `claude-cli-wrapper` 6-tool case study), output contract (`CallToolResult` text+JSON vs other content types), JSON-RPC error code discipline (`-32602` for schema violations, custom codes for domain failures, `-32603` only for wrapper crashes), tool annotations (readOnlyHint/destructiveHint/idempotentHint/openWorldHint), pass-through principle for deep structures, context budget (≤12 KB total schema, ≤2 KB per tool), capability negotiation (tools/resources/prompts/sampling/elicitation), security MUST/SHOULD checklist (Origin header validation, OAuth Resource Server since June 2025 spec, treat annotations as untrusted), naming conventions, the Claude-Optimal validation checklist.
  - **`mcp-server-implement`** (the production) — Build an MCP server in Rust with `rmcp` + `schemars` + `tokio`. Cargo.toml setup with the right features (`server`, `transport-io`, `transport-streamable-http-server`, `macros`), the macro cheat sheet (`#[tool_router]`, `#[tool_handler]`, `#[tool]`, `Parameters<T>`, `JsonSchema`), schemars attribute mapping table (length/range/regex/format → JSON Schema), enum idioms (rename_all, hyphenated variants), optional field patterns (`skip_serializing_if`), state management with `Arc<Mutex<...>>`, server lifecycle (initialize → capabilities → shutdown), transport choice (stdio vs Streamable HTTP vs legacy HTTP+SSE, decision matrix), stderr-only logging (`tracing-subscriber` with `with_writer(stderr)`), error mapping (`McpError::invalid_request/invalid_params/method_not_found/internal_error`), output construction, testing with the MCP Inspector, building and shipping (cross-compile, LTO/strip).
  - **`mcp-tool-surface`** (the meta) — JSON Schema authoring for tools. Constraint design (enum/pattern/range/format/length for every property), `additionalProperties: false` discipline, `oneOf` vs discriminator-enum tradeoff (the 95/5 rule), `$ref` vs inline, draft-2020-12 selection, required vs optional decisions, the "schema is an LLM instruction manual" framing, description-writing recipe (what/format/constraints/safety), tool name conventions (snake_case, verb_noun, domain prefix when 5+), nested objects (2-level rule), defaults that help, output schemas, common-pitfalls catalog.
- **`claude-cli` skill (claude-cli-wrapper plugin 0.2.0)**: New skill body for the existing `claude-cli-wrapper` plugin. Documents the 6 tools (`claude_execute`, `claude_session`, `claude_context`, `claude_review`, `claude_agent`, `claude_config`), per-tool semantics, key parameters, common workflows (one-shot / multi-turn / background agent / code review / structured output), output contract, and anti-patterns. The skill is the user-facing map of the binary; the design rationale lives in `mcp-server-design`.
- **marketplace.json**: `tp-mcp` plugin entry added (category: development, version 0.1.0). Marketplace catalog version bumped to 0.15.0 (from 0.14.0).

### Design decisions
- **Plugin namespace:** `tp-mcp` (sibling of `tp-git`, `tp-fpf`, `tp-sadd`, `tp-rust`) — keeps the MCP knowledge in its own plugin rather than bloating `core-principled`.
- **3 skills, not 4-5:** The 3 skills have non-overlapping triggers (design / implement / schema authoring) — that's the routing test for whether to split. Quality evaluation and client patterns are deferred follow-ups.
- **JSON Schema 2020-12 default:** Per the MCP spec. Explicit `$schema` field recommended for clarity.
- **Streamable HTTP over legacy HTTP+SSE:** The new standard for remote MCP servers. Legacy HTTP+SSE retained only for backward compatibility with 2024-11-05 clients.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **`tp-rust` plugin (0.1.0)**: New domain-specific plugin with four skills covering the full Rust project lifecycle, derived from a 4-track research effort (workspace, project layout, tooling, release/dependencies) analyzing 25+ production repositories and 150+ sources:
  - **`rust-scaffold`** — Scaffold a single-crate Rust project (lib, bin, or both) with modern defaults. Default edition 2024, MSRV 1.81, resolver 2, cargo-nextest-ready structure, doctests, MSRV-aware lints. Includes Cargo.toml template, MSRV policy (api-guidelines + RustCrypto camp split), feature flag playbook ("should be additive" with mutual-exclusion escape hatch), rustdoc conventions, edition migration checklist.
  - **`rust-workspace`** — Manage a Cargo workspace: when to split, three workspace anatomy templates, workspace inheritance (1.64+) with the additive-defaults pitfall (cargo #12162), MSRV coordination, cross-crate patterns (reqwest `__internal` feature), real-world patterns table (tokio, axum, ripgrep, cargo, rust-analyzer, deno).
  - **`rust-quality`** — Set up CI + clippy + nextest + coverage + supply-chain ladder. Copy-pasteable GitHub Actions workflow (dtolnay + Swatinem + taiki-e stack), clippy policy (pedantic for libs), nextest profile, cargo-deny `deny.toml` (verified against 0.19+ schema, no `vulnerability`/`unlicensed` removed keys), cargo-vet Stage 2, DX tools (bacon, sccache, mold), criterion benchmarking.
  - **`rust-release`** — Manage the release lifecycle. Cargo semver (pre-1.0 vs 1.0+, MSRV policy decision), changelog tooling decision (git-cliff vs release-please vs hand-curated), publishing playbook (3 hard rules, yank semantics, workspace lockstep), dependency management (MSRV-aware updates, `[patch.crates-io]`, vendoring), supply-chain ongoing maintenance (cargo-vet, Dependabot), feature deprecation 3-step cycle.
- **marketplace.json**: `tp-rust` plugin entry added (category: development, version 0.1.0). Marketplace catalog version bumped to 0.14.0 (from 0.13.0).

### Design decisions
- **Plugin namespace:** `tp-rust` (sibling of `tp-git`, `tp-fpf`, `tp-sadd`) rather than bolting onto `core-principled`. The 4 skills are cohesive and distinct from the existing principles.
- **4 skills, not 3 or 5:** Maps 1:1 to the natural Rust lifecycle (scaffold → structure → quality → release) with minimal overlap. Cross-skill handoffs documented in each skill (e.g., `rust-quality` → `rust-release` for supply-chain ongoing maintenance).
- **Edition 2024 + MSRV 1.81 as defaults:** edition 2024 is stable since Rust 1.85 (Feb 2025); MSRV 1.81 unlocks the MSRV-aware resolver (Sept 2024). Both are ahead of much of the ecosystem but right for new projects.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **`web-search` skill** (core-principled 0.12.0): tool-agnostic best practices for finding, verifying, and evaluating information on the open web. Merges two competing drafts (information-retrieval lens + epistemology lens) into a single hub: cognitive discipline, query reformulation, source hierarchy (primary → secondary → tertiary), cross-reference verification with 3 gates, 17-row failure-modes table, and the discipline of stopping when an answer is unfindable. Description uses user-vocabulary triggers ("find X", "look up Y", "is this claim true", "what do experts say"). Files: `SKILL.md` + `references/{query-shapes,source-hierarchy,verification-protocol,when-not-to-search}.md`.

### Changed
- **core-principled bumped to 0.12.0** (from 0.11.0) for the new `web-search` skill.
- **marketplace.json**: `core-principled` description updated to mention web search best practices; keywords gain `web-search`, `web-research`, `fact-check`, `source-evaluation`.

### Fixed
- **ddd SKILL.md** (core-principled): Description rewritten from method-leaking to user vocabulary; "What This Skill Changes" section added; QUALITY mode expanded with 5-step Process, 4 Anti-Patterns, 4 Failure Cases; Failure Signal JSON schemas added for ARCHITECTURE and API modes; CONTRAST section added. Token budget ~1,688 tokens (well under 2,000 safe limit).
- **diagnose SKILL.md** (core-principled): H1 renamed to `## Routing Guidance`; original `## Routing Guidance` renamed to `## Activation Triggers`; orphaned Gemba Walk/VSM/Muda Analysis rows removed; CONTRAST section added.
- **ideation SKILL.md** (core-principled): "Create Ideas Mode" expanded from 1-line stub to full 9-line section with anchor/tail subagent roles, synthesis rule, ranked output format; CONTRAST section added.
- **8 skills CONTRAST sections** (core-principled + tp-fpf + tp-sadd + tp-session-audit): Added CONTRAST sections to kaizen, plan-do-check-act, refine, task-lifecycle, subagent-orchestration, fpf, sadd, session-analytics for routing mutual exclusivity.
- **plan-do-check-act SKILL.md** (core-principled): Corrupted fragment "ting why." removed; "Reference Index" renamed to "Agent Spawn Map".
- **session-analytics references** (tp-session-audit): `cross-analyze-protocol.md` and `adjudicate-protocol.md` expanded from stubs to full reference content.
- **CLAUDE.md**: Git Safety Protocol section added — "NEVER use `git reset --hard`" with surgical recovery alternatives.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-03

### Changed
- **tp-session-audit plugin**: Merged standalone `capture` skill into `session-analytics` hub as CAPTURE mode. The skill now has four modes: CAPTURE, INSPECT, REVIEW, ISSUE. Added trigger phrases for "capture session", "collect artifacts", "headless capture", "run verification capture", "profile a skill invocation", "audit skill routing", "measure hook in vivo". Removed standalone `plugins/tp-session-audit/skills/capture/` directory.
- **tp-session-audit commands**: Added `commands/capture.md` as thin router to `session-analytics` CAPTURE mode. All four commands now route through the unified hub skill.
- **marketplace.json**: tp-session-audit version bumped to 0.3.0. Description updated to reflect four modes.

### Changed
- **Structural demotion: multi-agent-patterns, tool-design, claude-headless** — These three skills have been demoted from standalone top-level skills to markdown reference files within hub skill `references/` directories:
  - `multi-agent-patterns` → `plugins/core-principled/skills/subagent-orchestration/references/patterns-reference.md`
  - `tool-design` → `plugins/core-principled/skills/subagent-orchestration/references/tool-design.md`
  - `claude-headless` → `plugins/tp-session-audit/skills/session-analytics/references/claude-headless.md`
- **subagent-orchestration SKILL.md**: Updated to imperatively cite both new reference files. `when_to_use` updated to reference `references/patterns-reference.md`. `references/patterns-reference.md` (Architecture Design section) updated to reference `references/frameworks.md` for LangGraph/AutoGen/CrewAI implementations.
- **core-principled plugin.json**: Removed references to deleted skills. Bumped version.
- **Deleted skill directories**: `plugins/core-principled/skills/multi-agent-patterns/`, `plugins/core-principled/skills/tool-design/`, `plugins/core-principled/skills/claude-headless/`.

### Changed
- **task-lifecycle skill**: Added DOCUMENT mode absorbing `update-docs` workflow. New mode handles documentation after IMPLEMENT completes: multi-agent tech-writer flow with analysis + tech-writer + review agents. Task-lifecycle now has four modes: CAPTURE, REFINE, IMPLEMENT, DOCUMENT. IMPLEMENT mode routes to DOCUMENT after Phase 3 (DoD verification) before moving task to done.
- **task-lifecycle/references/documentation.md**: New reference file with README templates, JSDoc patterns, index document checklist, and quality gates migrated from `update-docs`.
- **Deleted skill**: `plugins/core-principled/skills/update-docs/` — capabilities merged into task-lifecycle DOCUMENT mode.

### Changed
- **Agent color standardization**: Assigned semantic `color:` fields to all 27 agent definitions across the marketplace per the Agent Color Convention table in CLAUDE.md:
  - `red` (judges/critics/security): tp-critic, sadd-judge, fpf-logic-verifier, tp-code-reviewer
  - `blue` (architecture/generation/analysis): tp-analyzer, sadd-generator, fpf-hypothesis-generator, tp-plan-architect
  - `green` (implementation/integration): sadd-synthesizer, fpf-evidence-validator, tp-global-implementer, tp-transcript-rules-integrator
  - `yellow` (caution/validation/audit): tp-skill-auditor, fpf-trust-auditor, tp-plan-verifier
  - `purple` (complex reasoning/scoring): tp-comparator, sadd-expander, tp-grader
  - `orange` (meta-evaluator/diagnostic): tp-subagent-auditor, sadd-meta-judge, meta-reviewer, tp-transcript-rules-analyzer
  - `pink` (distinctive specialist): tp-transcript-rules-auditor
  - `cyan` (investigation/research/tracing): sadd-explorer, tp-test-strategist, tp-explorer, tp-researcher, tp-debug-tracer

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-02

### Changed
- **tp-sadd agents**: Renamed with `sadd-` prefix in both filename and frontmatter `name` field to match spawn directives in `sadd` skill. Agents affected: `explorer` → `sadd-explorer`, `judge` → `sadd-judge`, `meta-judge` → `sadd-meta-judge`, `generator` → `sadd-generator`, `synthesizer` → `sadd-synthesizer`, `expander` → `sadd-expander`.
- **tp-fpf agents**: Renamed with `fpf-` prefix in both filename and frontmatter `name` field to match spawn directives in `fpf` skill. Agents affected: `hypothesis-generator` → `fpf-hypothesis-generator`, `evidence-validator` → `fpf-evidence-validator`, `logic-verifier` → `fpf-logic-verifier`, `trust-auditor` → `fpf-trust-auditor`.
- **session-analytics CROSS-ANALYZE**: Fixed cross-plugin reference from `taches-principled:debug-tracer` to `core-principled:tp-debug-tracer`.
- **session-analytics ADJUDICATE**: Fixed agent references: `tp-sadd:judge` → `tp-sadd:sadd-judge`, fallback updated to `core-principled:tp-critic`.
- **marketplace.json**: Bumped to 0.12.0.
- **core-principled plugin.json**: Bumped to 0.10.1.
- **README.md**: Updated version to 0.12.0.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-02

### Changed
- **core-principled project-maintenance skill**: Merged `archive-plan` (plan archival + learnings extraction) and `memory-curator` (memory audit/dedup/archive/clean) into a single hub skill with five modes — `PLAN-ARCHIVE`, `MEMORY-AUDIT`, `MEMORY-DEDUP`, `MEMORY-ARCHIVE`, `MEMORY-CLEAN`. The /archive command now routes to the unified skill. Removed the two old skills; bumped `core-principled` to 0.10.0.
- **/archive command**: Now a thin router into the unified skill (no body duplication). Argument-hint exposes all five modes plus `--abandoned` (PLAN-ARCHIVE override) and `--days` (memory age threshold).
- **refine MEMORIZE + rules-orchestration SYNC**: Updated CONTRAST references from `archive-plan` to `project-maintenance PLAN-ARCHIVE`. The writer/reader topology is unchanged.
- **MEMORY-DEDUP / MEMORY-CLEAN accuracy**: Replaced the false `--directory` and `--yes` flag claims (which `dedup.py` does not implement) with the script's actual CLI (`directory` positional, `--threshold`, `--format`) and clarified that the script is read-only — resolution is performed by the agent via MEMORY-ARCHIVE. The safety boundary is now explicit user confirmation in conversation, not a `--yes` flag. SKILL.md `argument-hint` and body are now consistent (no `--yes`/`--dry-run` claim).
- **MEMORY-ARCHIVE archive location**: Aligned all mode examples on `~/.claude/archive/memory/{category}/{date}/` (the manifest format). The MEMORY-DEDUP example previously showed `~/.claude/archive/memory/2025-05/` (missing the `{category}/` segment) — now correct.
- **marketplace.json**: Bumped to 0.11.2 (was 0.11.1). `tp-force-multiplier` removed (no longer in this marketplace); `tp-session-audit` retained.

### Added
- **project-maintenance references/memory-locations.md**: New tiny reference extracting the memory-location list that was previously inlined in both AUDIT and CLEAN modes.

### Removed
- `core-principled/skills/archive-plan/` (moved into `project-maintenance`)
- `core-principled/skills/memory-curator/` (moved into `project-maintenance`)

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **tp-meta capture skill**: New skill that runs `claude -p` headless capture with canonical behavioral-verification flags. Produces three artifacts: debug log, stream-json output, persisted JSONL. Triggers on "capture session", "profile a skill invocation", "run verification capture".
- **tp-meta session-inspect multi-artifact routing**: Extended INSPECT mode to route by artifact type — `.jsonl` → JSONL parser, `.debug.log` → debug-log parser (extracts [HOOK]/[API]/[PERMISSION]/[ERROR] events), `.stream.jsonl` → stream-json parser (per-turn delta events).
- **tp-meta meta-review CROSS-ANALYZE mode**: New mode fans out three parallel specialists (forensic-analyst on stream-json, meta-reviewer on JSONL, debug-tracer on debug log), detects convergence across analysts. High-convergence findings (≥2 analysts) are the highest-signal outputs.
- **tp-meta meta-review ADJUDICATE mode**: New mode validates each cross-analyze finding with parallel evidence-validator + adversarial challenge. Classifies findings as validated/speculative/rejected. Uses `background: true` for concurrent per-finding validation.

### Changed
- **session-inspect description**: Added trigger phrases for parsing debug logs and stream-json ("parse debug log", "analyze hook events", "extract hook fires")

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- **meta-issue skill**: Fixed label creation order for non-admin users — issue now creates cleanly without label when gh label create fails due to insufficient permissions
- **tp-force-multiplier hook**: Rewrote SessionStart hook with conditional three-gate coaching instead of "all capabilities are mandatory" anti-pattern
- **tp-critic agent**: Commented out cross-plugin dead skill references (fpf, sadd, ddd, tdd, kaizen) for partial-install safety

### Changed
- **10 agent renames**: Dropped `fpf-` and `sadd-` filename prefixes across tp-fpf (4 agents) and tp-sadd (6 agents)
- **sadd JUDGE triggers**: Replaced bare-verb triggers with phrase-level specific ones to resolve routing collisions
- **create-plans skill**: All critic-loop sites now reference MAX_ITERATIONS=3 (per evaluation-protocol.md); vague template paths replaced with explicit `templates/brief.md`
- **execute-plans skill**: All critic-loop sites now bounded by MAX_ITERATIONS (3 for milestone, 2 for pre-execution/per-task); template paths now explicit
- **orchestrate command**: Expanded from 3-line stub to 8-step protocol referencing scratchpad, evaluation-protocol, and subagent-orchestration skill

### Added
- **orchestrate-solo command**: New first-class lightweight mode command — no subagents, no scratchpad, no critic loop; sequential in-context execution for small tasks
- **archive-plan hard precondition**: Phase 1 now enforces SUMMARY.md existence with structured JSON failure signal and --abandoned override path
- **subagent-orchestration routing**: Added --solo/--lightweight decision rules to skill Decision Router

### Removed
- **sadd JUDGE**: 5 bare-verb trigger phrases that caused routing collisions with refine/diagnose/git/create-plans

## [0.12.1] — 2026-06-02

### Added
- **`memory-curator` skill** (moved from `tp-vps-governance`): Audits, deduplicates, and archives Claude Code memory files. Modes: AUDIT, DEDUP, ARCHIVE, CLEAN. Includes `scripts/dedup.py` for semantic deduplication via Jaccard similarity.
- **`rules-orchestration` AUDIT mode**: Analyzes CLAUDE.md hierarchy for conflicts, duplications, and cross-file contradictions. Extracted from `config-auditor`.
- **`plan-verifier` agent tools**: Added `Write` and `Edit` to the allowlist for scratchpad-first evaluation protocol compliance.

### Removed
- **`tp-vps-governance` plugin**: Deleted after capability migration to core plugin. `config-auditor` absorbed into `rules-orchestration` AUDIT mode; `memory-curator` moved to `plugins/taches-principled/skills/memory-curator/`.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **`tp-meta` consolidated into single hub skill `session-analytics`**: Merged `meta-issue`, `meta-review`, and `session-inspect` into one skill with INSPECT / REVIEW / ISSUE decision router. Each mode has its own reference file (`references/inspect-reference.md`, `references/review-reference.md`, `references/issue-reference.md`). Commands updated to target the new hub skill. Plugin version bumped to 0.2.0.

### Removed
- **`meta-issue`, `meta-review`, `session-inspect` skills** (3 directories): Superseded by `session-analytics` hub.

## [0.11.1] — 2026-06-01

### Changed
- **Dissolved `scope-work` skill**: The hollow router (`add-task`/`refine-task`/`create-plans` routing) was removed — its three spoke files never existed and its triggers conflicted with `add-task`. Lifecycle skills now self-route via their existing CONTRAST frontmatter. References updated in `ideation`, `archive-plan`, `execute-plans`, and `refine`.
- **`sadd` DESIGN mode merged into `subagent-orchestration`**: Architecture design capability consolidated into the core `subagents` hub. `sadd` now redirects DESIGN to `subagent-orchestration` and focuses on COMPETE/JUDGE/EXECUTE/EXPLORE competitive evaluation. `sadd-architect` agent deleted as orphaned.
- **`kaizen` / `ddd` relationship clarified**: Both skills updated with explicit "Relationship" sections — `kaizen` as continuous design-time guardrails (the immune system), `ddd` as specialist structural analysis (called in for diagnosis). Mutual cross-references added.
- **Shared evaluation protocol extracted**: `execute-plans`, `refine-task`, and `implement-task` now reference `execute-plans/references/evaluation-protocol.md` for the shared judge pattern (chain-of-thought, MAX_ITERATIONS, 5.0/5.0 hallucination guard, scratchpad-first, weighted rubrics). Prevents drift across the three skills.
- **Memory/learnings handoff chain made explicit**: `archive-plan`, `refine` (MEMORIZE mode), and `rules-orchestration` (SYNC mode) now have explicit CONTRAST cross-references documenting the two-writers/one-reader chain feeding `.principled/memory/learnings.md`.

### Removed
- **`scope-work` skill** (4 files): `SKILL.md` + `references/{nano-spec,task-spec,roadmap}.md` — no spoke bodies, routing superseded by direct CONTRAST routing in lifecycle skills.
- **`sadd-architect` agent**: Orphaned when DESIGN mode moved to `subagent-orchestration`.

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-01

### Added
- **scope-work skill** (canonical plugin): Unified entry point for task lifecycle — infers work scale from input and routes to `add-task` (nano-spec), `refine-task` (task-spec), or `create-plans` (roadmap). 261 lines across SKILL.md + 3 references.
- **New official docs**: `docs/official/permissions.md` and `docs/official/plugins/plugins-reference.md` (refreshed from source).

### Changed
- **Skills preloading philosophy — "Better too much than not enough"**: Retired the restrictive rule limiting skill preloading to evaluation/critique agents only. All potentially relevant skills MUST now be preloaded on all agent types (execution, research, explorer, etc.) for deterministic capability access. Properly authored skills use progressive disclosure — baseline context consumption is extremely low (~500 tokens frontmatter + body, references on-demand). AI retains full autonomy to lazy-load deeper reference files based on task requirements. Updated `docs/official/agent-skill-integration.md`, `plugins/taches-principled/skills/subagent-orchestration/SKILL.md`, and CLAUDE.md.

- **Skill file path referencing standardized**: Eradicated `{baseDir}` and `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` variables from all skill bodies and references (12 files). Established two canonical rules: (1) paths resolve within the skill's folder by default, (2) only SKILL.md may cite supporting files — reference files must never cross-cite. Converted all passive citations ("You can read", "See reference") to deterministic IF→BEFORE imperatives. Documented in CLAUDE.md and skill-authoring SKILL.md.
- **Native Tool Referencing standard**: Eradicated hardcoded tool names from orchestration directives across 11 files. `Write tool access` → `write access`, `"use the Read tool"` → `"use your native tools"`, etc. This ensures forward compatibility when the underlying API migrates (e.g., Task→Agent rename). Documented in CLAUDE.md and skill-authoring SKILL.md as a core best practice.
- **CLAUDE.md Skill Discovery**: Rewrote section as "Skill Discovery & Routing Metadata" — explicitly names routing-participant fields (description, when_to_use only), defines the "Metadata-Only Gate" concept, elevates 200-char rule, and adds Anti-Pattern "No Method Leaking" with bad/good examples.
- **Skill descriptions cleaned** (5 skills, jargon → user vocabulary):
  - `diagnose`: "A3, Five Whys, Fishbone, Stack Trace" → "Find root causes of recurring problems, failed fixes, and complex bugs"
  - `security`: "SAST, DEPENDENCY-AUDIT, SECRETS-DETECTION, COMPLIANCE" → "Scan for security vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, and broken authentication patterns"
  - `kaizen`: "YAGNI" → "avoid over-engineering"
  - `plan-do-check-act`: "PDCA cycle" → "Plan a change, try it at small scale, measure results"
  - `tdd`: "Red-Green-Refactor TDD" → "Write tests first, then implementation"
- **Must-do cleanup pass** (commit `55a6ba0`):
  - H1: Removed 2 tracked `.pyc` files; broadened `.gitignore` to `plugins/**/__pycache__/`
  - H2: Fixed broken CONTRAST references to non-existent `rule-propagator`
  - H4: Standardized `tp-force-multiplier` author to "Felix" across all 9 plugins
  - H5: Added `repository`, `license`, `keywords` to all marketplace.json entries
  - M3: Moved `commands-standard.md` to `docs/templates/command.md`
  - M4: Stripped redundant `shell: bash` from 33 files
  - M5: Stripped redundant `user-invocable: true` from 2 files
  - M6: Stripped dead YAML frontmatter from 15 templates/workflows
- **Plugin subagent rename for global uniqueness**: prefixed plugin subagents to avoid collisions when the `Agent` tool resolves across the marketplace:
  - `plugins/taches-principled/skills/create-plans/agents/{architect,explorer,implementer}` → `plan-{architect,explorer,implementer}`
  - `plugins/taches-principled/skills/rules-orchestration/agents/{rules-analyzer,rules-auditor,rules-integrator}` → `transcript-rules-{analyzer,auditor,integrator}`
  - `plugins/tp-sadd/agents/{architect,explorer}` → `sadd-{architect,explorer}`
  - `plugins/taches-principled/agents/implementer` → `global-implementer`
  - `plugins/taches-principled/skills/execute-plans/agents/researcher` → `execute-researcher`
- **README brittleness reduction**:
  - Stripped 4 magic-number count headers (`### 23 Skills`, `### 14 Commands`, `### 13 Agents`, `### 8 Marketplace Plugins`).
  - Collapsed 3 enumeration tables (Skills, Commands, Agents) to 5 curated examples each + filesystem pointers.
  - Fixed unclosed code block fence in "Full Marketplace Setup" (line 110).
  - Added `### README Hygiene` subsection to CLAUDE.md "Before Any Commit" self-check to make the discipline explicit.
- **CLAUDE.md description cap reconciliation**: changed self-check from `≤150 chars` to `≤1,536 chars` (combined `description` + `when_to_use`) to match the official cap per `docs/official/skills.md`.

### Removed
- **Orphan agent files** (untracked, unreferenced, superseded): `global-rules-{analyzer,auditor,integrator}.md` — the `transcript-rules-*` agents in `rules-orchestration/` do this work.
- **Empty directories**: `plugins/taches-principled/rules/`, `plugins/tp-vps-governance/agents/`.
- **Tracked Python bytecode** (2 files in `tp-force-multiplier/hooks/__pycache__/`).
- **Stale `.gitignore` line** referencing the removed `launch-subagent` skill directory.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-29

### Added
- **tp-meta plugin**: Session meta-review and behavioral analysis plugin with 3 skills, 1 agent, and 3 commands.
  - `session-inspect` skill: parses Claude Code session transcripts (JSONL) into structured data — tool calls, errors, cost, loaded plugins, behavioral events.
  - `meta-review` skill: reviews sessions for behavioral anti-patterns, investigates root causes with parallel subagent fan-out, and produces scoped findings.
  - `meta-issue` skill: creates GitHub issues from meta-review findings, sanitized for public sharing with privacy audit gate.
  - `meta-reviewer` agent: diagnostic agent that reads JSONL transcripts and identifies tool misuse, skipped verifications, and instruction-following failures with root cause scoping (PLUGIN/USER-FILE/ENVIRONMENT/MODEL).

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-27

### Added
- **tp-force-multiplier plugin**: Hook-driven coaching plugin that steers Claude to use subagents and skills more via real-time semantic coaching.
